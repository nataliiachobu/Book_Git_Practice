Hello my friends,
What is your favorite movie of 2023?
Make some changes to this file from github
My favorite movie is John Wick part 4.

Would you please, check your code again, for some reason I can't compile it. Another test shooting . You need to  fetch and then update the project to see the changes in Local git. But if you want to make changes from local git to github you need to commit  first and then to push it.
